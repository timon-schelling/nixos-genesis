# Genesis of my NixOS configuration

This repo contains the commits during the first chaotic days of my NixOS configuration journey. I started with a minimal configuration and added packages and configurations as I needed them. I also tried to keep the configuration as modular as possible. If you want to see the current state of my configuration, check the new repo.

## Genesis

In the beginning, there was a void, and from this void arose the chaos of disordered systems. Dependencies clashed, configurations were scattered across the system, and the world of software was in turmoil.

A developer saw this chaos and envisioned a system of order, where every package would exist in harmony, defined by its essence. This system would be pure, declarative, and reproducible, a foundation of stability in a world of flux.

The developer gathered his tools began the work. He wrote expressions, pure and immutable, that would bring order to the chaos. He defined packages, services, and configurations, each in its proper place, each with its dependencies resolved.

And so, the developer looked upon the creation and saw that it was good. Users who adopted this system found peace and stability, their configurations pure and their dependencies resolved. NixOS, a beacon for those seeking order in their digital lives.
